## Description

This is my very first react project used to create my portfolio, also my first time using tailwind for styling. This will be work in progress as I will be updating it as I learn more about react. Througout the time I spent working on this project, I learend there are numerous free react libraries that I have access to revamp the portfolio. In order to do so, I need to biuld a strong fundamental understanding of React.

## Usage

It can be used for any website or application that has a need of the social networking aspect.
